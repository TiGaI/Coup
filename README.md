# Coup
Coup, the popular board game of deception and manipulation. Play against friends and opponents from around the world!

My team and I create this game to compete in a gaming app hackathon hosted by Horizons School of Technology.  In this project, we use socket.io, react-native, mongodb, node, and express. The following are instruction on how the game works:

You can create private games with your friends anytime, each match supports up to four players. You can add friends to your friend list by inviting them directly, importing from your contacts, using Facebook, or by adding favorite players you've met in any of the ranked matches.

Five awesome characters each with their own abilities. The Captain can steal from your opponents and block incoming steals. The Assassin can assassinate another player card. The Contessa can block assassination attempts. The Duke can claim tax and earn three coins. The Ambassador can exchange cards and block steals.
